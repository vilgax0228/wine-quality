Two datasets are included, related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests.

Dataset Characteristics: Multivariate  
Subject Area: Business  
Associated Tasks: Classification, Regression  
Feature Type: Real  
Features: 11

Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available.

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):  
1 - fixed acidity  
2 - volatile acidity  
3 - citric acid  
4 - residual sugar  
5 - chlorides  
6 - free sulfur dioxide  
7 - total sulfur dioxide  
8 - density  
9 - pH  
10 - sulphates  
11 - alcohol  

Output variable (based on sensory data):  
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
